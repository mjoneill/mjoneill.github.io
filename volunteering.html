      <h2>Opportunities</h2>
      When you volunteer at SAINT, you make a difference for homeless cats.
      <h3>Cleaners</h3>
        <p>Each day we have two cleaning shifts, AM and PM.
          Volunteers are responsible for cleaning the cages and community rooms.
          This includes sweeping, refilling dry food, providing fresh water, and scooping
          litter boxes.</P>
      <h3>Open House Greeters</h3>
        <p>SAINT is open every Saturday from 11am-3pm. During this time, we need
          volunteers to greet our visitors and take them through the shelter.
          You may also have time to socialize and play with the cats and kittens.</p>
      <h3>Fostering</h3>
      <p>Fosters are needed for a variety of reasons. Cats or kittens may be placed
      with a foster for a few days; others may need a few weeks or months.</p>
      <ul class="foster">
        <li>Caring for kittens, especially those that are newborns.</li>
        <li>Socializing cats or kittens that are not completely comfortable with humans.</li>
      </ul>
